> A rudimentary LIRC simulator

This tiny piece of software simulates a [lircd](http://www.lirc.org/) and is listening on 127.0.0.1:8765. It replies 
`SUCCESS` without `DATA` to all received commands. 2 Seconds after a client connects it broadcasts a single button press 
of `button1` of `remote1`. Another 2 seconds later `button2` will be pressed 3 times with incrementing repeat counter
and 400ms pause between each press. That's all. ;-)

I use this for automated testing of [lirc-simulator](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/lirc-simulator).


# Install

`npm install -g lirc-simulator`


# Usage

Just call `lirc-simulator` - there is no config file and no command line parameters.
